Topic: Maternal Mortality, Source: UN Data Set
I recently learned that the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed nation.  I am undertaking this project in order to explore the root causes of this crisis, and their relationship to age, socio-economics, ethnicity, and nationality.  
If you know of and useful data sets that I can explore, please include links in your ocmments.
Thank you for taking the time to read about my project!
