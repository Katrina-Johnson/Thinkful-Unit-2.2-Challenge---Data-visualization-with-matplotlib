Topic: Maternal Mortality, Sources: America's Healt Rankings: United Health Foundation, and UN Data Set

The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed nation.  This project will explore the root causes of this crisis, and their relationship to age, socio-economics, ethnicity, and nationality.  

If you know of any applicable data sets, please include links in your comments.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my project!
